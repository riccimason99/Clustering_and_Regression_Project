# Optimizing the Dublin Bikes Grid

Dublin Bikes is a city-run bike pick-up and drop-off system with 115 bike stations throughout the city. These bikes provide convenient transportation options; however, customers can be frustrated when they arrive at the bike station near their destination and can not drop off their bikes because the station is full. 

This project optimises the Dublin Bikes Grid by changing the number of bikes in several stations based on information obtained by using machine learning clustering algorithms. Recommended changes will prevent the busiest stations from becoming full during peak hours. We then move forward to predict the usage of the altered stations using regression.

## Data and Code 

Data for this project is pulled from the [Data.gov.ie](https://data.gov.ie/dataset/dublinbikes-api), which maintains datasets on bike station activity, including the total number of bike stands at each station and the number of bikes at each station at any given time.

The code included pulls the data directly from the data.gov.ie site. Relevant data is then subset and transformed for the project's use.
