# Optimizing the Dublin Bikes Grid

Data for this project is pulled from the Data.gov.ie site, which maintains datasets on bike station activity, including the total number of bikes and empty bike stands at each station at any given time.

The code included pulls the data directly from the data.gov.ie site. Relevant data is then subset and transformed for the project's use.
